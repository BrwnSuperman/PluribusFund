          To protect funders' donations and investments, all organizations seeking funds through Pluribus will be subject to our due diligence process. Our due diligence process includes background information on project leadership, organization history and a credible plan what the funds will be used for. Any campaign not able to provide this information will never be hosted here. In addition to protecting funders' investments, this process is designed to enhance the credibility and trust given to all projects hosted by PluribusFund to maximize funding.
